The infamous Lab 5
some different versions of the circuit.The NAND NOR version uses three-input NAND and NOR gates. The other version uses 3-inut NAND and 2 2-inut NOR gates. After that, the only difference is which way the inverter is pointing, uoto all zones secure, or down to arm request latch. Either way, I can't figure out how to get around using an inverter on the output of "all zones secure", or its NOT verion.
