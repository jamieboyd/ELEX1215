The infamous Lab 5
some different versions of the circuit.The NAND NOR version uses three-input NAND and NOR gates. The other version uses 3-inut NAND and 2 2-inut OR gates. So output signal is not "all zones secure" but "at least one zone is breached" After that, the only difference is which way the inverter is pointing, up to "all zones secure", or down to "arm request latch". Either way, I can't figure out how to get around using an inverter because "all zones secure" and "arm request latch" need opposite polarity signals.
